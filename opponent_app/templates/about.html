  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Summery">Summery</span></h3>
      Dynamic fun game in the company of like-minded people. A lot of positive emotions and funny situations during the game. You are actively spending time with friends, chatting and exercising at the same time.

  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Service">Service</span>
  </h3>
  <p>The players spin a racket to decide who serves first. This player starts the first rally by electing to serve from either the left or right service box. For a legal serve, one of the server\'s feet must be in the service box, not touching any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike the front wall above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to <strong>volley</strong> a serve after it has hit the front wall. If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point. If the server loses the point, the opponent then serves, and can serve from either box.
</p>
  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Play">Play</span></h3>
<p>After the serve, the players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, as long as it hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line along the top of the tin is considered to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor and any number of times against the side or back walls before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player\'s movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot, as it is the optimal position in the court to receive the opponents shot. The centre of the court is typically referred to as [the T], named after the shape of the floor lines.
</p>
  <h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Strategy_and_tactics">Strategy and tactics</span></h3>
<p>A key strategy in squash is known as [dominating the T] the intersection of the red lines near the centre of the court, shaped like the letter [T], where the player is in the best position to retrieve the opponent\'s next shot. Skilled players will return a shot, and then move back toward the [T] before playing the next shot. From this position, the player can quickly access any part of the court to retrieve the opponent\'s next shot with a minimum of movement and possibly maximising the movement required by the opponent to answer the returned shot.
</p>
  <p>A common tactic is to hit the ball straight up the side walls to the back corners; this is the basic squash shot, referred to as a [rail], straight drive, wall, or [length]. After hitting this shot, the player will then move to the centre of the court near the [T] to be well placed to retrieve the opponent\'s return. Attacking with soft or [short] shots to the front corners referred to as [drop shots] causes the opponent to cover more of the court and may result in an outright winner. Boasts or angle shots are deliberately struck off one of the side walls before the ball reaches the front. They are used for deception and again to cause the opponent to cover more of the court. Rear wall shots float to the front either straight or diagonally drawing the opponent to the front. Advantageous tactical shots are available in response to a weak return by the opponent if stretched, the majority of the court being free to the striker.
</p>
  <p>Rallies between experienced players may involve 30 or more shots and therefore a very high premium is placed on fitness, both aerobic and anaerobic. As players become more skilled and, in particular, better able to retrieve shots, points often become a war of attrition. At higher levels of the game, the fitter player has a major advantage.
</p>
  <p>The ability to change the direction of the ball at the last instant is also a tactic used to unbalance the opponent. Expert players can anticipate the opponent\'s shot a few tenths of a second before the average player, giving them a chance to react sooner.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Interference_and_obstruction">Interference and obstruction</span></h3>
<p>Interference and obstruction are an inevitable aspect of squash, since two players are confined within a shared space. Generally, the rules entitle players to a direct straight line access to the ball, room for a reasonable swing and an unobstructed shot to any part of the front wall. When interference occurs, a player may appeal for a [let] and the referee or the players themselves if there is no official then interprets the extent of the interference. The referee may allow a let and the players then replay the point, or award a [stroke] to the appealing player meaning that he is declared the winner of that point depending on the degree of interference, whether the interfering player made an adequate effort to avoid interfering, and whether the player interfered with was likely to have hit a winning shot had the interference not occurred. An exception occurs when the interfering player is directly in the path of the other player\'s swing, effectively preventing the swing, in which case a stroke is always awarded.
</p>
  <p>When it is deemed that there has been little or no interference, the rules provide that no let is to be allowed in the interests of continuity of play and the discouraging of spurious appeals for lets. Because of the subjectivity in interpreting the nature and magnitude of interference, awarding or withholding of lets and strokes is often controversial.
</p>
<p>Interference also occurs when a player\'s shot hits their opponent prior to hitting the front wall. If the ball was travelling towards the side wall when it hit the opponent, or if it had already hit the side wall and was travelling directly to the front wall, it is usually a let. However, it is a stroke to the player who hit the ball if the ball was travelling straight to the front wall when the ball hit the opponent, without having first hit the side wall. Generally after a player has been hit by the ball, both players stand still; if the struck player is standing directly in front of the player who hit the ball he loses the stroke; if he is not straight in front, a let is played. If it is deemed that the player who is striking the ball is deliberately trying to hit his opponent, they will lose the stroke. An exception occurs when the player hitting the ball has [turned], i.e., letting the ball pass them on one side, but then hitting it on the other side as it came off the back wall. In these cases, the stroke goes to the player who was hit by the ball.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Referee">Referee</span></h3>
<p>The referee is usually a certified position issued by the club or assigned squash league. Any conflict or interference is dealt with by the referee. The referee may also take away points or games due to improper etiquette regarding conduct or rules. The referee is also usually responsible for the scoring of games. Three referees are usually used in professional tournaments. The Central referee has responsibility to call the score and make decisions with the two side referees.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scoring_system">Scoring system</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Point-a-Rally_to_11">Point-a-Rally to 11</span></h3>
<p>Games are played according to point-a-rally scoring [PARS] to 11 points. PARS is almost universally preferred by the game\'s top professionals, and is the current official scoring system for all levels of professional squash tournaments. In PARS, the winner of a rally receives a point, regardless of whether they were the server or returner. Games are played to 11 and must be won by two points. That is, if the score reaches 10â€“10, play continues until one player wins by two points. Competition matches are usually played to [best-of-five] games i.e. the first player to win three games.
